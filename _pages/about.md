I'm Nadine, I do science, research software engineering, photography and ultra mountain running. 
In this blog, I want to share my work, thoughts, tools, art, and other bits of knowledge that have some chance of being useful or interesting to others. Read more about my work [here] (https://nadinespy.github.io/about-me/).
