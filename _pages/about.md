I'm Nadine, a scientist and research software engineer. (Also photographer and ultra mountain runner.) 
In this blog, I want to share my work, thoughts, tools, art, and wisdom - stuff that's been useful/interesting to me and that has some chance of being useful to others, too! Read more about my work[here] (https://nadinespy.github.io/about-me/).
