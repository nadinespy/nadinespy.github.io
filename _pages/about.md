I'm Nadine, a software developer and computational scientist with experience in building LLM-based software products, complex systems research, and technical AI safety research. My work draws on 6+ years of experience spanning AI/ML, data science, research, and scientific software development.

I'm also an ultra mountain runner and engage in photography.

In this blog, I share my work, thoughts, tools, art, and wisdom. Read (a lot) more about me [here](https://nadinespy.github.io/about-me/).
