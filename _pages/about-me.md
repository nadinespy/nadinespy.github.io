### Research software engineering
I am currently a [research software engineer](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/people/nadine-spychala) at King's College London within a newly established [central research software engineering team](https://docs.er.kcl.ac.uk/research_software_engineering/). In this role, I generally aim to write science-enabling software that is more reproducible, shareable, and scalable, and allows to more easily build upon existing research. For me, being a research software engineer means to contribute to a larger project – that of improving science. Currently, I am involved in co-building a genAI-based, to-be-commercialised app to enable the collection of rich but narrowly scoped qualitative data at scale. This work operates across human-computer interaction research and product development where we build production-ready software while requirements are still being discovered through research - a challenge distinctive to _scientific_ software. You can read about a pilot study using a prototype of the app in this [paper](https://dl.acm.org/doi/full/10.1145/3706598.3713999).

Beyond this project, I've developed software in ML-based research initiatives, establishing scientifically rigorous analysis pipelines from inception - contributing both engineering and research expertise. My role involves bridging technical and non-technical worlds: communicating complex concepts to researchers and stakeholders, and contributing to broader conversations such as [AI's impact on research software engineering](https://www.software.ac.uk/blog/ai-after-my-job-navigating-future-research-software-engineering).

### Research in computational neuroscience, complex systems and technical AI safety
I have recently completed a PhD in computational neuroscience and complex systems at the [Sussex Centre for Consciousness Science](https://www.sussex.ac.uk/research/centres/sussex-centre-for-consciousness-science/), University of Sussex. My doctoral research (comprising three to-be-published studies - watch out for preprints!) addresses both conceptual/philosophical and empirical questions about multi-scale relationships in complex systems, focusing on formal, information-theoretic approaches to emergence and complexity. Conceptually, I co-developed a framework that rethinks emergence as a non-binary, multi-dimensional construct. Empirically, I systematically validated a broad range of emergence and complexity measures across multiple simulated time-series models and micro/macro-scales to inform empirical research on time-evolving systems. I also examined multi-scale measures in learning systems employing Approximate Bayesian Inference, a method from machine learning. 

Beyond this, I've leveraged my expertise in complexity science/emergence research for AI safety within a [PIBBSS fellowship](https://pibbss.ai/). I synthesized philosophical, mathematical, and empirical research on emergence to advance AI capability assessment - specifically exploring how measures of emergence could be used for AI evaluations. I progressed on technical feasibility and outlined next steps toward a deployable emergence assessment pipeline. Here's a [talk on my AI safety research project](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAzncDxGUxs). 

### AI/ML and datascience experience
My work with AI/machine learning spans several domains beyond the technical AI alignment and LLM-based software development work mentioned above. During my PhD, I applied unsupervised ML techniques to derive candidate emergent macro-scales in simulated time-series models. Prior to my doctoral research, I used unsupervised machine learning to investigate robotic hand control via motor imagery and experiences of embodiment in an [EEG-based brain-computer interface study](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2019.00461/full). Following this, I investigated the dynamics of integrated information (a complexity measure) in black-box variational inference, a foundational technique used in ML for approximating intractable posterior distributions in Bayesian inference. This study formed the basis for investigating multi-scale measures in learning systems employing Approximate Bayesian Inference as part of my PhD.

Apart from machine learning applications and foundations, I've conducted data science work across multiple domains. As a research data scientist in medical education research, I applied statistical analyses to questionnaire data to inform the development of practice- versus competence-based assessment procedures in medical education. This directly informed regional educational policy questions and resulted in a [co-authored publication](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32579039/). Through my (doctoral) research, I've developed deep expertise in information theory (an advanced branch of statistics), time-series modelling, and Bayesian methods. Early in my career, I investigated the generalizability of quantitative studies in experimental (neuro)psychology through analysis of deployed sampling methods – work that highlighted critical issues in external validity.

### Open science research software advocacy
As a 2023/2024 [Software Sustainability Institute](https://www.software.ac.uk/) (SSI) Fellow, I sent a strong signal for the institute's mission of "better software, better research" by delivering research software development workshops to research communities I actively participate in. You can check out (and re-use) material for a [research software enginnering tutorial in Python](https://hackmd.io/@nadinespy/rkteKiVDn) that I’ve created for the Artificial Life conference 2023 in the context of my fellowship. As part of my PhD project, I developed [ComplexPy](https://openlifesci.org/posts/2022/03/17/ols-4-participant-nadine-spychala/) – a Python library (still work in progress) designed to make different complexity and emergence measures easily applicable and comparable across datasets in an intuitive, comprehensive way. In the context of my EEG-based BCI study, I've developed a [bootstrapping function for two-way mixed effects ANOVA](https://nadinespy.github.io/posts/2020/04/bootstrapping-function-for-2way-mixed-effects-ANOVA/) in R. I've been an active contributor to the open science ecosystem through regular participation in [Brainhacks](https://brainhack.org/) and other hackathons, some of which have resulted in open-source software contributions. All code from my past and ongoing research is published and documented.

### Education and mentoring
I’ve been engaged in knowledge sharing across diverse educational contexts and audiences. In my current role as a research software engineer at King's, I have provided support for HPC training, Git/GitHub and Python for students and staff. During my academic research, I've taught courses spanning ML fundamentals, Algorithmic Data Science, Practical Philosophy, and EEG methods, and supervised machine learning theses. I've delivered research software engineering tutorials and served as a mentor multiple times in the [Open Seeds mentoring and training program](https://we-are-ols.org/open-science-training.html#open-seeds), helping participants (from marginalised groups) to open-source their software projects. I've also taught German to refugees, and was, early in my career, involved in an "Idea-Of-Man" seminar that approached psychological topics from philosophical, political, and sociological perspectives, coaching students to critically reflect on these interdisciplinary connections.

### Interdisciplinarity and seeing the big picture
Most of my research has been hugely interdisciplinary, intersecting mathematics, machine learning, neuroscience, as well as philosophy. My doctoral work in particular required extensive bridge-building between abstract mathematical measures and their conceptual meanings.

I have been the main organiser of a symposium titled [Rethinking Computational Approaches to the Mind - Fundamental Challenges & Future Perspectives](https://computationalmind.github.io/), which brought together researchers to examine critical questions about computational approaches in the mind sciences. Have a look at the [recorded talks and panel discussion](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLoIPNxWj9puhD9kCjnvOEWdY_jVPhcWJu) which included, amongst others, Melanie Mitchell, Konrad Kording, and Gaël Varoquaux.

I thought much about metascientific questions, one outcome of which is an extensive article-like post on [collaboration in science](https://nadinespy.github.io/posts/2023/05/collaboration-in-science-happier-people-better-research/), arguing that shifting from individualistic to more collaborative work in academia is needed to improve scientific progress and increase well-being. This is particularly crucial in the mind sciences where research methodology is especially challenging.

Currently, I'm exploring the fundamental tension between Buddhist non-attachment and taking action in a written piece – how Buddhism teaches us to _loosen_ our grip on views to reduce suffering, while action requires (some minimum) _clinging_ to views. I examine the cycle of loosening perspectives during assessment, then solidifying around synthesized views to generate energy for action, and address Buddhism's limitations in providing concrete guidance for what we should actually do beyond responding "skillfully."

### Psychology and policy advocacy
I have a background in psychology and worked as a psychologist for unaccompanied refugee minors at [Bahia](https://www.bahia-bremen.de/). I also engaged in pedagogical psychology work at [Children for Tomorrow](https://www.children-for-tomorrow.com/en/), supporting vulnerable refugee children and adolescents. At [Equality California](https://www.eqca.org/), I worked as a policy advocate on public education projects while also developing initiatives to address biphobia.

### Volunteering
I engaged in a peace-building project providing non-violent protective accompaniment during the olive harvest for Palestinian communities, working alongside Israeli and international volunteers to ensure safe agricultural access for farmers facing movement restrictions and settler violence, while participating in dialogue and witness-bearing with local peace organizations. Earlier, I worked as an environmental sustainability volunteer at [GrowNYC](https://www.grownyc.org/) in New York City, supporting local food systems and waste reduction efforts. I was also active with [Amnesty International](https://www.amnesty.org/en/) in Hamburg, Germany, contributing to human rights advocacy work.

### Art and the outdoors
I engage in photography and share my work on a [photo blog](https://continuousminds.wordpress.com/) (discontinued - new work will be posted elsewhere) as well as on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/continuousminds/). I also post about (ultra mountain and sky)running, the outdoors more generally & music/culture in the UK/around the world in [another account](https://www.instagram.com/nads.py/). In this blog/personal website, I share writings on various topics.
