### Scientific software development
I am currently a [scientific software developer](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/people/nadine-spychala) at King's College London within a newly established [central research software engineering team](https://docs.er.kcl.ac.uk/research_software_engineering/). Generally, I aim to write science-enabling software that is more reproducible, shareable, and scalable, and allows to more easily build upon existing research. For me, being a scientific software developer means to contribute to a larger project – that of improving science. Currently, I am involved in building a gen-AI-based, to-be-commercialised app to enable the collection of rich but narrowly scoped qualitative data at scale. The app leverages AI chaining to enable the design of a scaffold that breaks the narrative creation into easily-to-accomplish steps while automating difficult aspects and preserving users' agency to revise and personalize their stories. This work sits at the intersection of human-computer interface research and product development, involving the challenge of building a concrete product while requirements are continuously evolving. You can read about a pilot study using a prototype of the app in this paper.

### Research in computational neuroscience, complex systems and technical AI safety
I have recently completed a PhD in computational neuroscience and complex systems at the [Sussex Centre for Consciousness Science](https://www.sussex.ac.uk/research/centres/sussex-centre-for-consciousness-science/), University of Sussex. My doctoral research (comprising three to-be-published studies - watch out for preprints!) addresses both conceptual/philosophical and empirical questions about multi-scale relationships in complex systems, focusing on formal, information-theoretic approaches to emergence and complexity. Conceptually, I co-developed a framework that rethinks emergence as a non-binary, multi-dimensional construct. Empirically, I systematically validated a broad range of emergence and complexity measures across multiple simulated time-series models and macro-scales to inform empirical research on time-evolving systems. I also examined multi-scale measures in learning systems employing Approximate Bayesian Inference, a method from machine learning. Beyond this, I've leveraged my expertise in complexity science/emergence research for AI safety within a [PIBBSS fellowship](https://pibbss.ai/). My aim was to bring together various strands of research (philosophical, formal/mathematical and empirical) on the concept of emergence to inform and bring progress on research in AI capabilities. I ultimately intended to explore whether gained insights can be channelled into evals-type of work to produce a deployable “emergence-assessment pipeline” for assessing AIs w. r. t. their emergent capabilities. Here's a [talk on my AI safety research project](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAzncDxGUxs). 

### AI/ML and datascience experience
My work with AI/machine learning spans several domains beyond the technical AI alignment and LLM-based software development work mentioned above. During my PhD, I applied unsupervised ML techniques to derive candidate emergent macro-scales in simulated time-series models. Prior to my doctoral research, I used unsupervised machine learning to investigate robotic hand control via motor imagery and experiences of embodiment in an [EEG-based brain-computer interface study](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2019.00461/full). Following this, I investigated the dynamics of integrated information (a complexity measure) in black-box variational inference, a foundational technique used in ML for approximating intractable posterior distributions in Bayesian inference. This study formed the basis for investigating multi-scale measures in learning systems  employing Approximate Bayesian Inference as part of my PhD.

Beyond machine learning applications and foundations, my data science work extends to statistical analysis and research methodology across diverse domains. As a research data scientist in medical education research, I analysed questionnaire data to inform the development of practice- versus competence-based assessment procedures in medical education. This work resulted in a [co-authored publication](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32579039/) applying statistical methods to inform educational policy questions. Through my (doctoral) research, I've developed deep expertise in information theory (an advanced branch of statistics), time-series modelling, and Bayesian methods. Earlier in my career, I investigated the generalizability of quantitative studies in experimental (neuro)psychology through analysis of deployed sampling methods – work that highlighted critical issues in external validity.

### Open science research software advocacy
As a 2023/2024 [Software Sustainability Institute](https://www.software.ac.uk/) (SSI) Fellow, I sent a strong signal for the institute's mission of "better software, better research" by delivering research software development workshops to research communities I actively participate in. You can check out (and re-use) material for a [research software enginnering tutorial in Python](https://hackmd.io/@nadinespy/rkteKiVDn) that I’ve created for the Artificial Life conference 2023 in the context of my fellowship. As part of my PhD project, I developed [ComplexPy](https://openlifesci.org/posts/2022/03/17/ols-4-participant-nadine-spychala/) – a Python library designed to make different complexity and emergence measures easily applicable and comparable across datasets in an intuitive, comprehensive way. This development work was supported through my participation in the [Open Seeds mentoring and training program](https://we-are-ols.org/open-science-training.html#open-seeds), where I also served as a mentor to other open science and open software enthusiasts. In the context of my EEG-based BCI study, I've developed a [bootstrapping function for two-way mixed effects ANOVA](https://nadinespy.github.io/posts/2020/04/bootstrapping-function-for-2way-mixed-effects-ANOVA/) in R. I've been an active contributor to the open science ecosystem through regular participation in [Brainhacks](https://brainhack.org/), some of which have resulted in open-source software contributions. All code from my past and ongoing research is published and documented, ensuring reproducibility and enabling others to build upon my work.

### Education and mentoring
I’ve been engaged in knowledge sharing across diverse educational contexts and audiences. In my current role as a scientific software developer at King's, I have provided support for HPC training. During my academic research, I've taught courses spanning ML fundamentals, Algorithmic Data Science, Practical Philosophy, and EEG methods, and supervised machine learning theses. I've delivered research software engineering tutorials and served as a mentor multiple times in the Open Seeds mentoring and training program, helping participants to open-source their software projects. I've also taught German to refugees, and was, early in my career, involved in an "Idea-Of-Man" seminar that approached psychological topics from philosophical, political, and sociological perspectives, coaching students to critically reflect on these interdisciplinary connections.

### Big picture thinking and interdisciplinarity
Most of my research has been hugely interdisciplinary, intersecting mathematics, machine learning, neuroscience, as well as philosophy. My doctoral work in particular required extensive bridge-building between abstract mathematical measures and their conceptual meanings, work that demanded both technical precision and philosophical clarity.

I thought much about metascientific questions, one outcome of which is an extensive article-like post on [collaboration in science](https://nadinespy.github.io/posts/2023/05/collaboration-in-science-happier-people-better-research/), arguing that shifting from individualistic to collaborative work in academia can improve scientific progress and increase well-being, particularly crucial in the mind sciences where research methodology is especially challenging.

I organized a symposium titled [Rethinking Computational Approaches to the Mind - Fundamental Challenges & Future Perspectives](https://computationalmind.github.io/), which brought together researchers to examine critical questions about computational models of cognition. Have a look at the [recorded talks and panel discussion](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLoIPNxWj9puhD9kCjnvOEWdY_jVPhcWJu).

Currently, I'm exploring the fundamental tension between Buddhist non-attachment and effective action – how Buddhism teaches us to _loosen_ our grip on views to reduce suffering, while meaningful action requires _clinging_ to views. I examine the cycle of “loosening” perspectives during assessment, then “solidifying” around synthesized views to generate energy for action, while addressing Buddhism's limitations in providing concrete guidance for what we should actually do beyond acting “skillfully.”

### Psychology and human rights work
I have a background in psychology and worked as a psychologist for unaccompanied refugee minors at [Bahia](https://www.bahia-bremen.de/). I also engaged in pedagogical psychology work at [Children for Tomorrow](https://www.children-for-tomorrow.com/en/), focusing on supporting vulnerable young people. During an internship at [Equality California](https://www.eqca.org/) in Los Angeles, I contributed to public education projects including The Breakthrough Conversation and Health Happens With Equality, while also initiating a project addressing biphobia.

### Volunteering
I worked as an environmental sustainability volunteer with GrowNYC's Zero Waste and Greenmarket programs in New York City, supporting local food systems and waste reduction efforts. Earlier, I was active with Amnesty International in Hamburg, Germany, until 2012, contributing to human rights advocacy work.

### Art and sports
I engage in photography and share my work on my [photo blog](https://continuousminds.wordpress.com/) (disctontinued - new work will be posted elsewhere) as well as on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/continuousminds/). I also post about (ultra mountain and sky)running, the outdoors more generally & music/culture in the UK/around the world in [another account](https://www.instagram.com/nads.py/). I share writings on various topics in this blog.
